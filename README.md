# Discord-Call-Ip-Sniffer


🕵️‍♂️ VoIP-Sentinel: Advanced UDP Voice Packet SnifferVoIP-Sentinel is an advanced, high-performance network research utility engineered in Python. It is specifically designed to facilitate the monitoring, interception, and analysis of UDP-based voice traffic within real-time communication (RTC) architectures.📖 Table of ContentsProject OverviewTechnical ArchitectureSafety & EthicsPrerequisitesDetailed InstallationConfiguration GuideThe Science of VoIP SniffingTroubleshootingAPI DocumentationRoadmapContribution🔍 Project OverviewModern VoIP applications utilize complex obfuscation to protect user data. VoIP-Sentinel aims to deconstruct these layers by analyzing packet headers and identifying specific RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) signatures.⚙️ Technical Core1. Raw Socket LayerThe engine utilizes socket.SOCK_RAW to bypass the standard transport layer abstractions. This allows the tool to read every bit of data entering the Network Interface Card (NIC) before the OS filters it.2. Intelligent Protocol FilteringBy targeting the UDP High-Port Range (50000-65535), the tool ignores irrelevant noise (HTTP/S, DNS, etc.) and focuses solely on potential voice streams.3. RTP Pattern MatchingOur algorithm scans the first 16 bits of the UDP payload for the \x00\x01 magic byte sequence, a common identifier for Discord's proprietary voice encapsulation.4. Concurrency ModelThe sniffer operates on a non-blocking, multi-threaded architecture:Thread A: Discord Gateway Monitoring (WebSocket).Thread B: Low-level UDP Sniffing.Thread C: Real-time console logging and I/O.⚠️ Safety & DisclaimerTerms of Service: The use of automation on user accounts (self-bots) is a violation of Discord's ToS and will lead to account termination.Legal: This tool is for educational research only. Unauthorized interception of data is illegal in many jurisdictions.System Integrity: Running raw sockets requires Root/Admin privileges, which grants the script full access to your network stack.🛠️ PrerequisitesRequirementSpecificationOSWindows 10/11 or Linux (Kernel 4.x+)Python3.8 or higherPrivilegesAdministrator / Sudo accessNetworkEthernet recommended (WiFi may drop packets)📝 The Science of VoIP SniffingTo understand how this tool works, one must understand the OSI Model. While most apps live at Layer 7, VoIP-Sentinel peers into Layer 3 and 4.The Capture Flow:Handshake Detection: Identifying the initial STUN/ICE requests.Traffic Analysis: Sorting packets by length (Voice packets are usually small and consistent).IP Extraction: Stripping the IP header to reveal the source and destination nodes.🚀 Installation & SetupStep 1: Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/VoIP-Sentinel.git
